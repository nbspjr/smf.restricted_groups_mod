smf.restricted_groups_mod
=========================

This is a module for Simple Machines forum that allows forum administrators to limit certain groups per board so they can view only their topics within a board.

It is not supposed to be used on large forums with many boards.

Usage
=====

Just edit a board of your choice and select groups you wish to limit to see only their own topics

Notes
=====

Should work with SMF2.0+, but the current package-info.xml includes only 2.0.4 version.
